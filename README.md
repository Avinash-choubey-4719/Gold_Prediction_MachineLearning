About Dataset
Data Overview: This data file is a Comma separated value file format with 2290 rows and 7 columns. It contains 5 columns which are numerical in datatype and one column in Date format. 
Clearly the data shows value of the variables SPX,GLD,USO,SLV,EUR/USD against the dates in the date column.

PREPROCESSING:
We preprocess all the data by using basic techniques like dropping all the columns with missing values.The most preprocessing was done to the dates, 
the dates were in different formats and they were formatted to a common format which would be understood by matplotlib for plotting it appropriately.
